The CMS spectrum
-----------------
When you think about it probably 80% of the apps in existence are some specialization of a content management system.

I see the CMS spectrum as running from static sites to traditional services like Wordpress and Drupal.
In between are some interesting options but we need to remember our goals 
The traditional CMS "Wordpress" is still king as of 2018. 
Headless CMSes are popping up all over the place now and fill an interesting niche since they can be used as an API.

Static site generators are still popular with the developer crowd but won't catch on with most users. 
An interesting combo is to static render traditional Wordpress or serve content from a cache if possible.
