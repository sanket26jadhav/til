# Shipping with Confidence

Trying to remember what Harry from Shopify was talking about at yesterday's Big Data Enthusiasts meetup.

He had some good strong intro but it left me wanting more from the rest of the presentation. Too great expectations?
Here's a summary of the key points that I got out of it.

- Invest in Tools, the hidden 3rd dimension of the speed vs stability fallacy
- Parallel deploys or as he called it "Log before you Leap" to get real production cycles in your spooky changes
- Deploy more often to make easier to spot and fix bad commits
- Treat production as a platform for devs

Overall it was a good talk that could have goen much longer to cover all the interesting topics he briefly touched on.
