Swift
=====

In iOS you have to follow MVC.

@IBOutlet define variables that refer to UI elements so you can make changes to them.

@IBAction define functions that respond to UI events.

Guard is like an "unless".
 
The if let name = optionalName form for "Optional Binding"  is only testing for the existence of a value within an optional.

Optional Chaining 
let opt = blah?.blah2?.blah()
opt will be nil if any part of the chain is nil

Closures

Completion handlers (passing functions as arguments)

Trailing closure syntax: {() in }

Typealias to give helpful names to types

What is "<-" operator?
