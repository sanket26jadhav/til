Building Web Apps with Spring Framework and Spring Boot
=======================================================

Spring is a framework of many independent modules that can be combined to build enterprise-level apps on the JVM.

Spring Core is a dependency management library that will automatically wire up dependencies in your application using either XML configuration files or Java-annotations.

Spring-Boot is an opinionated selection and packaging of modules from Spring that let you build Web-Apps as self-contained and executable JAR files.
